This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL related to string manipulation using the MOVE statement. The `bug.cob` file contains a program that shows unexpected behavior when moving strings using the MOVE statement without careful consideration of string lengths. The `bugSolution.cob` file provides a solution.  The issue stems from the fact that MOVE only copies the specified number of characters; it doesn't automatically pad or truncate strings.  This example highlights the importance of precise string length handling to avoid unexpected results in COBOL string operations.
